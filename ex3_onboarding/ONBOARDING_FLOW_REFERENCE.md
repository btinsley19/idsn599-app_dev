## üéØ Milestone Progress System

### **4 Main Milestones** (UPDATED MAPPING)
1. **"Getting to Know You"** (Pages 3-5: Name, Why, Current Journey)
2. **"Your Goals"** (Pages 6-9: Short-term Goals, Long-term Goals, Strengths, Growth Areas) 
3. **"Your Habits"** (Pages 10-12: Info Sources, Interests, Networking)
4. **"Final Touch"** (Pages 13-14: Final Reflection, Personal Plan)

### **Progress Features** (ENHANCED)
- **Gradual progress bar**: Fills continuously across all pages (0% to 100%)
- **Milestone completion**: Previous milestones turn green with checkmarks when advancing
- **Confetti/glow effects**: Trigger when completing each milestone section
- **Smooth transitions**: Between phases with proper milestone timing
- **Visual feedback**: Current milestone highlighted in blue, completed in green

## üé® Unified Pill Selection Pattern

### **Implementation Across Pages**
The following pages use the unified pill selection pattern:
- **ShortTermGoalsPage**: Short-term goals
- **LongTermGoalsPage**: Long-term goals
- **StrengthsPage**: Strengths
- **GrowthAreasPage**: Growth areas
- **PersonalInterestsPage**: Personal interests
- **NetworkingStylePage**: Networking styles

### **Pattern Features**
- **Custom Input Field**: TextField with "Add" button for user-created entries
- **Unified Display**: All items (suggested + custom) appear in the same pill list
- **Auto-Highlight**: Custom entries automatically appear as highlighted when added
- **Consistent Behavior**: All pills use the same selection/deselection logic
- **Space Efficient**: No duplicate storage or display of selections

### **User Experience**
1. User sees suggested options as unselected pills
2. User can click suggested pills to highlight them
3. User can type custom entries in the text field
4. Custom entries automatically appear as highlighted pills
5. All selections are saved when navigating to the next page

## üîß Common Patterns

### **Page Structure**
```swift
struct PageName: View {
    @Binding var onboardingData: OnboardingData
    @Binding var currentPage: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 24) {
            // Header
            // Content
            // Navigation buttons
        }
    }
}
```

### **Validation Pattern**
- Required fields disable "Next" button until valid
- Auto-advance on valid input where appropriate
- Clear error states and feedback

### **Component Usage**
- **Chip**: Multi-select options with gradient selection (unified pill pattern)
- **Custom Input Fields**: TextField + Add button for custom entries
- **CardSelection**: Single-select journey stage (DEPRECATED: Now uses chips for multi-select)
- **CheckboxList**: Information sources with emojis
- **GradientButton**: Primary CTAs
- **FileUploadCard**: Optional file upload component
- **Purple Gradient Text Fields**: Custom styled text inputs with theme borders

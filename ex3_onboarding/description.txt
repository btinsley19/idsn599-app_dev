I've created an onboarding flow for my idea of an AI powered Rolodex.
This app will help users achieve their personal and career goals by surfacing relevant talking points (from news headlines, meeting notes, etc.)
The onboarding flow here is meant to capture the essence of the user so that Rolo can gain context and a North Star to follow when guiding them in their growth.
The key is having the user feel dopamine spikes and perceived value as they fill it out so that when the paywall comes they feel theyve already gotten value.

I did a spin on the clicker app where you build a city.
Houses, business buildings, and skyscrapers generate random ranges of jobs/housing.

i used a linear gradient in the background and rectangles to create the buildings/windows

the horizontal scroll view was nice to allow you to scroll left/right onthe city you made

at certain set populations, you get a milestone update of the size of your city

also along the way you get an update of the balance of people/jobs for unemployment/labor shortage
